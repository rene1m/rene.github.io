    <p>The black box is most likely a drain sort of thing on the inside and it leads to a connected tubes that goes into the drain, and out to the exit.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>At first we thought that it was a sort of mix of tubes that went all in different spirals which is why it took a second for water to pour out. My approach was to connect a tube to the thing on the top, that pours water into the big bucket/drain and connect that to another bucket with a tube that leads to the exit so it can pour water out, explaining why some water poured out would be because some was poured out of the drain because it overflew, and why some was kept inside was because the bucket caught water that leaked out. But what my group's model function was supposed to be, is that we have 2 cups/buckets of water and it was supposed to drop water when enough was poured in, it would then drop into a bucket with a tube and it would pour out water, we eventually tested it and it sorta worked. We did 5 tests/trials. The 1st test we poured in 400 and 250 came out, 2nd test we poured in 250 and 86 came out, 3rd test we poured in 500, and 620 came out, 4th test we poured in 250 and 130 came out, 5th and last test we poured in 50 and 0 came out. After these various tests my original thought of what might’ve been inside has been changed and I've been more open minded about what might be what's inside, but still haven’t completely forgotten and said my original idea was wrong, but I now think it’s between mine or this.</p>
